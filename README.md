This is the constitution of the Faculty of Information Technology Society - or WIRED Monash. We are making this public so WIRED members can create and track proposed amendments. This project was inspired by UNSW CSESoc, who has done a similiar thing to their constitution.

If you have any enquiries, please contact the Secretary at wired (at) monashclubs.org.
